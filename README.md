# ðŸŽ€ Cutedoc

Cutedoc is a fast and clean static site generator for beautiful project documentation pages, written in Go.

## Features

- Write documentation using Markdown
- Easy to setup, with only a single `.ini` file
- Outputs static HTML that can be hosted anywhere
- Supports syntax highlighting and emojis
- Easily extensible with custom themes using [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
- Built-in development server

## MkDocs theme

This project started as a theme for MkDocs, but I've since made it into its own static site generator. However, the MkDocs theme is still maintained under the [mkdocs branch](https://github.com/Twometer/cutedoc/tree/mkdocs). It's the same theme as the default branch for the new generator.
